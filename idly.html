It is a savory steamed cake made from a fermented batter consisting of rice and black lentils (urad dal).

                <b>Preparation</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rinse the idli rice and urad dal separately under running water until the water runs clear.</li>
                        <li>Soak the rice and urad dal separately in enough water for about 4-6 hours. </li>
                        <li>Add fenugreek seeds to the urad dal while soaking.After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

                <b>Grinding the batter</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a wet grinder or a high-powered blender, grind the soaked urad dal until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. You may need to add a little water while grinding to achieve the desired consistency. The batter should be thick and airy.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the urad dal batter into a large bowl.Now grind the soaked rice into a smooth paste. The texture should be slightly coarse compared to the urad dal batter.</li>
                        <li>Mix the rice batter with the urad dal batter, adding salt to taste. Combine well using your hands or a spatula. The batter should be thick but pourable.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fermentation</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or overnight. During this time, the batter will rise and become slightly airy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

                <b>Making Idlis</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>After fermentation, gently mix the batter to deflate any air bubbles that may have formed.</li>
                       <li>Grease the idli molds with a little oil or ghee.</li>
                       <li>Pour ladlefuls of the batter into each mold, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>
                       <li>Steam the idlis in a steamer for about 10-12 minutes or until they are cooked through. You can check the doneness by inserting a toothpick or a knife into the center of an idli - it should come out clean.</li>
                       <li>Once done, remove the idli molds from the steamer and let them cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
                       <li>Use a spoon or a butter knife to gently remove the idlis from the molds.</li>
                    </ul>

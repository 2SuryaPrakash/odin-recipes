                <b>Preparation</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rinse the idli rice and urad dal separately under running water until the water runs clear.</li>
                        <li>Soak the rice and urad dal separately in enough water for about 4-6 hours. </li>
                        <li>Add fenugreek seeds to the urad dal while soaking.After soaking, drain the water from both the rice and urad dal.</li>
                    </ul>

                <b>Grinding the batter</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a wet grinder or a high-powered blender, grind the soaked urad dal until it becomes a smooth and fluffy batter. You may need to add a little water while grinding to achieve the desired consistency. The batter should be thick and airy.</li>
                        <li>Transfer the urad dal batter into a large bowl.Now grind the soaked rice into a smooth paste. The texture should be slightly coarse compared to the urad dal batter.</li>
                        <li>Mix the rice batter with the urad dal batter, adding salt to taste. Combine well using your hands or a spatula. The batter should be thick but pourable.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <b>Fermentation</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or overnight. During this time, the batter will rise and become slightly airy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <b>Making Dosas</b>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                       <li>After fermentation, gently mix the batter to deflate any air bubbles that may have formed.</li>
                       <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet or dosa tawa over medium heat.</li>
                       <li>Once the skillet is hot, pour a ladleful of the batter onto the center of the skillet.</li>
                       <li>Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. You can make the dosa as thin or thick as you prefer.</li>
                       <li>Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and on the surface.</li>
                       <li>Cook the dosa for 1-2 minutes or until the edges start to crisp up and turn golden brown.</li>
                       <li>Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.</li>
                       <li>Once both sides are cooked to your desired crispness, transfer the dosa to a plate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
